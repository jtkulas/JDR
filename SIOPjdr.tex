\maketitle

The job demands-resources model (Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner, \& Schaufeli, 2001) and later job demands-resources theory (Bakker \& Demerouti, 2017) have inspired a plethora a study on the process and experience of job stress and employee motivation in recent decades. In the current project, we draw attention to a basic question regarding a key assumption we make regarding this process - that of the objective nature of job characteristics as either demands or resources. The major contribution of this project is to document whether job context and characteristics (pulled from O*Net) can simultaneously be classified as resources and as demands. We further present descriptive information regarding which job context and characteristics are rated the highest across jobs.

\subsection{The Job demands-Resources Theory}\label{the-job-demands-resources-theory}}

The job demands-resources theory is an extension of the well-known job demands-resources model put forth by Demerouti and colleagues in 2001 (Demerouti et al., 2001). The job demands-resources model had been so heavily studied that a number of meta-analyses have been possible (e.g., (Crawford, LePine, \& Rich, 2010);
(Halbesleben, 2010); (Nahrgang, Morgeson, \& Hofmann, 2011)). The theory generated by the model integrates both the job design and job stress literatures to help explain the conditions under which a job would result in employee stress vs.~motivation (Bakker \& Demerouti, 2014). Per the job demands-resources theory, both work environment and job characteristics can be modeled via job demands and resources. Demerouti et al. (2001) define job demands broadly as components of a job that require sustained effort, and as such, produce psychological or physiological strain (e.g., high work pressure is frequently cited as a common demand). Resources, on the other hand, are physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job that may help an employee achieve work goals, reduce job demands, or promote personal growth and development (Demerouti et al., 2001).
Experiencing an element of one's job as a resource or demand activates one of two distinct processes: either health impairment (demands) or motivation (resources; (Bakker \& Demerouti, 2014). Job characteristics perceived to be demanding are effortful are frequently associated with negative outcomes such as exhaustion (e.g., Bakker, Demerouti, \& Schaufeli, 2003). On the other hand, job characteristics perceived as resources (fulfil psychological needs) are associated with positive organizational outcomes like engagement and motivation (Bakker, Hakanen, Demerouti, \& Xanthopoulou, 2007).

\subsection{Objective vs.~Subjective Nature of Demands and Resources: The Role of Appraisal}\label{objective-vs.-subjective-nature-of-demands-and-resources-the-role-of-appraisal}}

Searle and Auton (2015) note that the majority of the research on workplace demands is based on apriori classifications of demands. However, the stress experience, or process, described early on by Lazarus and Folkman (1984) is grounded in the assumption that individual appraisals of stressors/demands vary. Their transactional theory or stress and coping states that people continuously appraise stimuli in their environments. An appraisal is the cognitive process whereby meaning is assigned to a stimulus. If a stimulus is appraised as a stressor (threat, challenge, potentially harmful), emotional distress leads to coping of some kind. This action to cope is also associated with another appraisal about the outcome itself and the process continues if the outcomes is not appraised as favorable (Lazarus \& Folkman, 1984). The stress appraisal process suggests that classifying a job characteristic or environmental condition as an objective demand or resource might be in error.
We next consider the (limited) empirical evidence on this topic. First, some relatively recent research suggests that job demands and resources may not be universally appraised or assigned as such. Starting with job demands, Webster, Beehr, and Love (2011), for example, studied workload, role ambiguity, and role conflict demands, and found while that each could be appraised primarily as challenges or hindrances demands, they could also simultaneously be perceived as being both a challenge and hinderance to different degrees. While their study did include resources, it nonetheless points to individual difference on how people perceive stressors at work. Although part of a much larger study on retirement, Sonnega, Helppie-McFall, Hudomiet, Willis, and Fisher (2018) compared self-reported (subjective) ratings of degree of physical demand, stress, and need for intense concentration from the Health and Retirement Study with objective ratings from O*Net. Correlations physical demand (r = .52), stress (r = .10), and need for intense concentration (r = .14), again suggesting perhaps that our objective ratings of job demands (and resources) may be subject to a greater level of individual difference than assumed. Next considering resources, Schmitz, McCluney, Sonnega, and Hicken (2019) captured subjective and objective resources in their study of retirement also. Correlations of composite variables for the resources of autonomy (r = .12), recognition of work (r = .07), decision freedom (r = .08), and advancement (r = -.01), while significant, certainly do not reflect high levels of overlap.
We do acknowledge as well, that demands and resources are not necessarily consistent across days, or seasons, for many employees. Downes, Reeves, McCormick, Boswell, and Butts (2021) meta-analysis addresses this reality in depth, although it is beyond the scope of this project.

\subsection{Current Study and Hypotheses}\label{current-study-and-hypotheses}}

The current study aims to explore the degree to which job context and job characteristic items from O*Net are considered demands and resources. Given theoretical and empirical findings, it seems quite plausible that our apriori assignment of job elements to a \enquote{demand} or \enquote{resource} category may be too simplistic. We aim to document a list of the highest rated demands and resources, as well as information on overlap of job characteristics as demands and resources, in addition to addressing the following predictions.

Bakker and Demerouti (2017) state that, \enquote{\ldots research has shown that challenge demands may be experienced as hindrance demands (and vice versa) depending on the context} (p.~278). We extend this acknowlegement by investigating whether some characteristics of work may also vacillate between demand and \emph{resource}.
